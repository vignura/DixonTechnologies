Q1 FY2019:
----------
1) The consolidated revenue for quarter ended June 30, 2019 was 1147 Crores as against 594 Crores in the same period last year. This is a growth of almost 93%. On consolidated EBITDA for the quarter was Rs.53.15 Crores as against 27.25 Crores in the same period last year that is a growth of 95%. Consolidated PAT for the quarter was 23.58 Crores against 12.76 Crores in the same period last year, which is a growth of almost 35%.

2) In the consumer electronics segment, which is dominated by televisions, the revenues for the quarter under review was 510 Crores against 223 Crores, which is a growth of 129% over the last year’s quarter, first quarter. This was mainly due to our new customer acquisition that is Xiaomi. Xiaomi since has got a hold position, it is number one, it is smart television market in India.

3) The operating margins have also expanded from 1.1% to 2.2%. We have made a very strong start in the second quarter with July being the best month in our operating history. So far we clocked the sale of 2.4 lakhs TV. We have also expanded the capacity in our Tirupati plant now from 2.4 million TVs to 3.6 million annually. This is the largest capacity that any company has in India. It is almost 25%.

4) Now, the SMT lines have been installed and sales one, the SMT PCVA there is 1 million per annum. The commercial production of SMT line has already started, so with this kind of infrastructure friends we are now the most vertically integrated TV plant in India. We are focusing a lot on our ODM solutions. So we have now R&D both in China and in India.

5) Next I go to the lighting segment. Revenue for the quarter has shown a growth of 71% year-on-year. In Q1 2020, we have clocked a turnover of 324 Crores as compared to 190 Crores in the same period last year.We have clocked the same volume of 19.4 million LED bulbs, which I feel there is more than 50% of the total Indian requirement. The new brand that we have added apart from Philips is Panasonic Anchor, Bajaj, Wipro, Orient, Ajanta, Syska, Polycab, Control and Switchgear, Jaguar, Usha, Looper and also Plunt.

6) We had already expanded the capacity in batons from 250K to 800K inn phase 1 and phase 2 should be over by Q3 of this fiscal we will have a capacity of 1.5 million. The total Indian requirement is around 5 million, so we are going to build a capacity in phase 2 of almost 30%, so the customers in LED bulb and batons performance

7) Next product line we are targeting is downlighters wherein we are at present at a level of around 150K a month. In phase 1, we are planning to expand it to 2.5 million that is 500K a month and then we plan to build it up to a million a month. From next fiscal we will have a couple of large accounts for export of LED bulbs because we feel that we are within top 4 globally now as far as the volume of LED bulb that we can and we have the cost comparativeness to enter the global markets so same thing that we have been able to do in LED bulbs.

8) We have more than 140 models. Our order book is fairly healthy. Our anchor customers, Samsung in January 2019 has more than doubled the volume and from July we added another model for them, which will take the volumes to almost half or mid in the year. So, in semiautomatic also we are planning a further capacity expansion to 105 million. If you recall in my last interaction that we have shared that we now have top loading fully automatic plant in place. This new plant will be coming up in Tirupati. The new parcel of land, which is contiguous to our existing campus has been acquired. The construction will be starting shortly. So we have finalized two platforms in this in both 6 and 7 kg category it will complete our portfolio and this factory will be operational in next fiscal.

9) The mobile phone segment, revenues for the quarter was 144 Crores for 100% against 73 Crores for 50% last year. Operating profit was 3.2 Crores to 100% as against 81 lakhs to 50% same period last year. The operating profits margins have improved to 2.2% in the current quarter as compared to 1.1% in the same period last year mainly this is due to the backward integration of PCBA that we have been, that is in operation now. So the PBCA backward integration capacity for mobile phones is 300k to 350k per month for Smart Phone and 750k per month feature phones.

10) So we have strive to build a large scale in mobile business and I am glad to inform and report you that we have got a very major breakthrough in this division and we have signed with a very close 250 accounts, which is in the top two in India and globally. So we have taken as a new factory in Noida and we have almost 2.2 lakh a square feet and we are setting up a capacity of 1.8 million phones in both domestic and export market. The trials in this factory would start in September 2019 the next month, and commercial production will start in Q3 from first week of October that is what we are targeting.

11) Reverse logistics is a segment which is more of a strategic nature, it is a, we are not making significant money there, so we have a negative operating profit of 11 lakhs in the last quarter of year this is primarily because of writing off of some unusable inventory. This will continue like that, this is more in a strategic sense because the main focus now there is on LED TV panel and we are doing it for Xiaomi so that is the way it is. (honest management !!!)

12) Well, there has been an investment by Reliance yesterday so one has to wait and watch that what it exactly means, what they are talking about because they are talking about 4k television the set top box free but on what package, what volumes but we also know that Reliance is our customer, Reliance is our large customer.

13) We are in the front of a Japanese Daikin partner. There is a company called Rexene which is the strategic partner for Daikin globally and it provides them the complete inverter control module solution. We are the manufacturing partner for India. I am seeing that this business is continuously growing. One Daikin is doing fairly well. Second it is a pretty strong AC season. Third there is an absolute shift towards the inverter base solutions so I am seeing a significant growth in the Q2 also. Third Daikin is sourcing for all their global factors of Rexene so some exports have also started from Dixon India to Daikin’s global.

Q2 FY2019:
----------
1) Consolidated revenues for quarter ended September 30, 2019 was Rs.1405 Crores against Rs.741 Crores in the same period last year. That is a growth of around 90%. Consolidated EBITDA for the quarter ended September 30th was Rs.65.9 Crores against 34.6 Crores in the same period last year that is a growth of 91%.

2) What I wanted to highlight in this half yearly performance has been a strong generation of free cash flows, post capex we generated free cash of around 65 Crores in the first six months. This is of course on account of improved profitability but more than that it is on account of improved working capital efficiency, this has also resulted in net debt reduction to Rs.52 Crores on September 30, 2019 against 96 Crores as on March 31, 2019 in spite of significant increase in the revenues

3) In consumer electronics segment, that is primarily LED televisions, the revenues for the growth come for the quarter Q2 2019-2020 was 738 Crores against 360 Crores in the same period last year, that is a growth of 105%. The operating profit also grew by 40% that is 17.7 Crores in this Q2 against 12.6 Crores in the same period last year

4) On our SMT side currently we have a capacity of 1 million and by the end of this fiscal we will further expand this capacity to 2.4 million. We have invested in R&D and we have a large R&D team both in India and China now. 

5) Also, an important development for us is that we are in very advance stages of an agreement closure with a very large brand we nominate both Indian and global market and we expect the production for that brand to commence from January 2020

6) Going to the next vertical lighting. Revenues to the quarter have grown by 49% year-on- year. we are at 284 Crores in Q2 against 190 Crores in the same epode last year. This is in spite of the CSL business completely shutting off. So, if I compare on like-to-like basis the growth would have been almost 56%. Increased volumes have led to almost 108% growth in operating profit, profit for this quarter is 23 Crores and as compared to 11 Crores in the same period last year. The margins in lighting business have also expanded from 5.8% in Q2 last year to 8.1% in Q2 this year

7) So now we have all the major brands in lighting industry in our portfolio most of them and all of them are primarily on ODM basis. We have also expanded our capacity in LED bulbs, which is now 20 million per annum, which is almost 50% of the Indian requirement. In the last quarter we have developed new solutions smart LED bulb and emergency bulbs which assuming to three prominent brands in India.
 
8) So now we have expanded our capacity in phase I in batons from 250K a month to 800K per month and in phase II that is by Q1 next fiscal this will be expanded to 1.5 million. So, the total Indian requirement we understand is around 5 million a month, we will be almost at 30%, please also appreciate that the brands whom they are servicing are having batoning is an important SKU in the product portfolio, so we are fairly confident that we will have a large customer base for batons also

9) Now with this increased volume that we have had, we feel that they are globally competitive and for one of our major anchor customers we start exports to the global market within December this year. We are in discussion with some large global chains and we are fairly confident that we will get a breakthrough in the international markets in lighting, in indoor lighting very shortly.

10) Coming to our home appliances, that is washing machine segment. Revenues for the quarter has grown by 34%, it is 139 Crores in Q2 financial year 2019-2020 as compared to 104 Crores last year. Operating profit has also grown by 94%, it is 16.4 Crores in Q2 FY2019- 2020 versus 8.5 Crores. The margins have expanded from 8.1% in washing machines in Q2 last fiscal to the 11.8% in the last quarter.

11) We are in advance stage of an agreement closure with a very large Indian multinational brand and for this particular brand the execution will start by December this year. I had shared with you that we are expanding into top loading fully automatic category. So, the plans are in place and this campus the factory is coming up in our Tirupati campus and we are targeting to start the production there by Q3 in next fiscal, we will have the complete range right from 6 kgs to 10 kgs category almost 30 models and we are in process of tying up with two large MNC brands this will consume almost 70% of our capacities

The production is being ramped up and we feel that by January or latest February in the next quarter we
should be able to achieve a 100% capacity of 127 or 128 million feature phones.

14) Udit D: 
My question is around the cost of material consume, so I wanted to check that on a standalone basis the cost of material consumed has moved from about 84% to about 90% as a percentage of sales. So, could you explain this movement?
Atul B. Lall:
Yes basically because of the change in sales mix. So, if you look at our quarterly numbers, it will be, the consumer electronics segment has contributed almost 50% of the sales and there the margin profile is generally lower as compared to what we make on the lighting or the washing machine home appliances segment so that is predominantly the reason.

15) Neelesh Wagle:
Another question I had is in the early 90‟s we use to see companies like TCL, Samtel, a lot of manufacturing companies in the electronic domain that use to make for our customers and do contract manufacturing and eventually these companies went Bosch because of significant pressures in terms of FX volatility and inventory obsolescence how has that business model the risk changed in the current time and I understand you are very diversified across business lines across customers and all of that it is not like you have a monocline large volume single product issue here. But has this manufacturing outsourcing business has that fundamentally changed over the years.
Atul B. Lall:
So in our case I will share with you, as we just shared that our business is primarily OEM that is a prescriptive mode and ODM which is our old reliant model now as far as our OEM business is concerned which is a largest chunk of a business it is both currency and inventory are agnostic so we do not take any inventory risk we do not take any currency risk. That is the way the value chain is designed. In the ODM part we carry the risk, but in the business model the way we have structured is we have kind of delisted to a very large extent but there can be some lag impact for some quarters. So that is the way the business is structured.

16) Praveen Sahay:
And lastly also on the AC PCB segment you are gaining a traction and numbers looking very good so how much is your target is to and in which plant you are doing this AC PCB.
Atul B. Lall:
That has been done in Noida plant only which we do for the company call Dixon and they supply to Daikin so that business is also growing and that business is also delivering decent profitability for us.
Praveen Sahay: 
And any target to achieve in that or you have a... 
Atul B. Lall: 
In this particular vertical our end customer that Daikin, which the Saurabh head is, do
extremely well in the Indian market so we feel that year-on-year we should be able to
achieve a growth of around 25% to 30%.
Praveen Sahay: 
Any capacity number can you say around that.
Atul B. Lall: 
These as we said that this capacity is fungible, so on SMP lines there we do a light products we also do our AC PCB so it is fungible capacity, so we have additional capacities and it is common to all so the TV PCB is the security system PCBs, camera PCBs, DVR PCBs, lighting PCBs, mobile PCBs, the surplus amount of capacity for the same and that is the main capex this all fungible capacity and that is what our core is
