-----------
1) The consolidated revenue for quarter ended June 30, 2019 was 1147 Crores as against 594 Crores in the same period last year. This is a growth of almost 93%. On consolidated EBITDA for the quarter was Rs.53.15 Crores as against 27.25 Crores in the same period last year that is a growth of 95%. Consolidated PAT for the quarter was 23.58 Crores against 12.76 Crores in the same period last year, which is a growth of almost 35%.

2) In the consumer electronics segment, which is dominated by televisions, the revenues for the quarter under review was 510 Crores against 223 Crores, which is a growth of 129% over the last year’s quarter, first quarter. This was mainly due to our new customer acquisition that is Xiaomi. Xiaomi since has got a hold position, it is number one, it is smart television market in India.

3) The operating margins have also expanded from 1.1% to 2.2%. We have made a very strong start in the second quarter with July being the best month in our operating history. So far we clocked the sale of 2.4 lakhs TV. We have also expanded the capacity in our Tirupati plant now from 2.4 million TVs to 3.6 million annually. This is the largest capacity that any company has in India. It is almost 25%.

4) Now, the SMT lines have been installed and sales one, the SMT PCVA there is 1 million per annum. The commercial production of SMT line has already started, so with this kind of infrastructure friends we are now the most vertically integrated TV plant in India. We are focusing a lot on our ODM solutions. So we have now R&D both in China and in India.

5) Next I go to the lighting segment. Revenue for the quarter has shown a growth of 71% year-on-year. In Q1 2020, we have clocked a turnover of 324 Crores as compared to 190 Crores in the same period last year.We have clocked the same volume of 19.4 million LED bulbs, which I feel there is more than 50% of the total Indian requirement. The new brand that we have added apart from Philips is Panasonic Anchor, Bajaj, Wipro, Orient, Ajanta, Syska, Polycab, Control and Switchgear, Jaguar, Usha, Looper and also Plunt.

6) We had already expanded the capacity in batons from 250K to 800K inn phase 1 and phase 2 should be over by Q3 of this fiscal we will have a capacity of 1.5 million. The total Indian requirement is around 5 million, so we are going to build a capacity in phase 2 of almost 30%, so the customers in LED bulb and batons performance

7) Next product line we are targeting is downlighters wherein we are at present at a level of around 150K a month. In phase 1, we are planning to expand it to 2.5 million that is 500K a month and then we plan to build it up to a million a month. From next fiscal we will have a couple of large accounts for export of LED bulbs because we feel that we are within top 4 globally now as far as the volume of LED bulb that we can and we have the cost comparativeness to enter the global markets so same thing that we have been able to do in LED bulbs.

8) We have more than 140 models. Our order book is fairly healthy. Our anchor customers, Samsung in January 2019 has more than doubled the volume and from July we added another model for them, which will take the volumes to almost half or mid in the year. So, in semiautomatic also we are planning a further capacity expansion to 105 million. If you recall in my last interaction that we have shared that we now have top loading fully automatic plant in place. This new plant will be coming up in Tirupati. The new parcel of land, which is contiguous to our existing campus has been acquired. The construction will be starting shortly. So we have finalized two platforms in this in both 6 and 7 kg category it will complete our portfolio and this factory will be operational in next fiscal.

9) The mobile phone segment, revenues for the quarter was 144 Crores for 100% against 73 Crores for 50% last year. Operating profit was 3.2 Crores to 100% as against 81 lakhs to 50% same period last year. The operating profits margins have improved to 2.2% in the current quarter as compared to 1.1% in the same period last year mainly this is due to the backward integration of PCBA that we have been, that is in operation now. So the PBCA backward integration capacity for mobile phones is 300k to 350k per month for Smart Phone and 750k per month feature phones.

10) So we have strive to build a large scale in mobile business and I am glad to inform and report you that we have got a very major breakthrough in this division and we have signed with a very close 250 accounts, which is in the top two in India and globally. So we have taken as a new factory in Noida and we have almost 2.2 lakh a square feet and we are setting up a capacity of 1.8 million phones in both domestic and export market. The trials in this factory would start in September 2019 the next month, and commercial production will start in Q3 from first week of October that is what we are targeting.

11) Reverse logistics is a segment which is more of a strategic nature, it is a, we are not making significant money there, so we have a negative operating profit of 11 lakhs in the last quarter of year this is primarily because of writing off of some unusable inventory. This will continue like that, this is more in a strategic sense because the main focus now there is on LED TV panel and we are doing it for Xiaomi so that is the way it is. (honest management !!!)

12) Well, there has been an investment by Reliance yesterday so one has to wait and watch that what it exactly means, what they are talking about because they are talking about 4k television the set top box free but on what package, what volumes but we also know that Reliance is our customer, Reliance is our large customer.

13) We are in the front of a Japanese Daikin partner. There is a company called Rexene which is the strategic partner for Daikin globally and it provides them the complete inverter control module solution. We are the manufacturing partner for India. I am seeing that this business is continuously growing. One Daikin is doing fairly well. Second it is a pretty strong AC season. Third there is an absolute shift towards the inverter base solutions so I am seeing a significant growth in the Q2 also. Third Daikin is sourcing for all their global factors of Rexene so some exports have also started from Dixon India to Daikin’s global.
